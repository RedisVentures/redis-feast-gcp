# Translating Feats to featureform

Key Differences:
[] docker/setup/apply.py -> Can instead be substituted by the `featureform apply` command
[] docker/setup/materialize.py -> Not needed; Featureformt akes care of the materialization upon apply & scheduling included
[] feature_store/data_fetcher.py -> Serving features for training & inference from the ServingClient
[] create.py + features.py -> Can be combined to create the definitions.py

Specifically, because Featureform leverages Kubernetes for orchestration, Cloud Functions and Cloud Scheduler aren't needed. 
Featureform also doesn't need to store the definitions in a 3rd backing store like GCS Buckets.
